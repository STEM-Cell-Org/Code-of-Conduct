# THS-Code-Of-Conduct

### 1) Act in accordance with the Constitution

##### Finalized by Enus 2020/3/23 00:06 EST

The Constitution is the guiding hand of the server and is a complete reference to how staff operates in accordance to electing new staff members, disputes, the addition or removal of rules to the Constitution and Code of Conduct, and the relationship between The Hackerspace and Vojes Enterprises. It is recommended that all members of The Hackerspace read the Constitution so they are aware of how the staff should function, and to call out inappropriate behavior that does not fall in line with the Constitution or Code of Conduct.

When asking for help, please do not be demanding of other members. No one is required to help you, staff and helpful members are part of this community in our free time. Swearing is allowed but keep in mind that abrasive members will have corrective action taken. Hate speech will not be tolerated. Racial slurs will result in your only warning and the offending message(s) removed. Repeat offenders will be banned. Replacing letters with symbols or punctuation (e.g. leet-speak) will count as an offense. No trolling, flaming, or intolerance of others' personal beliefs is allowed. Suicide and rape jokes will be held in contempt. This rule extends to private conversations with other members of the community as well. If we receive reports of harassment of another member outside of this community, corrective action will be taken against the offending member.

### 3) Stay on-topic

##### Finalized by Enus 2020/3/23 17:10 EST

Stay on-topic. Technology topics without a dedicated channel should go to off-topic. Do not deliberately veer off-topic in the categorized channels. Spamming text and voice channels is prohibited. No memes outside of off-topic unless it is relevant to the channel topic (e.g. you can post a funny meme about windows in information-technology but don't go overboard or start posting cat pictures). If on-topic memes get out of control, staff will be called to assess before taking corrective action. We like to have fun, but ultimately we don't want good information over saturated with non-serious posting. All voice channels are reserved for on-topic discussions or assistance purposes. Voice channels are first-come, first serve. If all voice channels are occupied, please be respectful of any current conversations.
